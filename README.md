# Predicting-Car-Purchase-Amount-With-ANN

Description:
This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features such as car make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and other attributes. Using a machine learning approach, I developed a robust predictive model to estimate car prices accurately. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Key highlights include:
Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
Conducting detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying trends and relationships in the data.
Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to identify the best-performing model.
Optimizing the best model to improve accuracy and reduce prediction error.

Features:
Machine learning model for predicting car prices.
Data preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing data.
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for understanding data patterns.
Visualizations for insights into car price determinants.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
